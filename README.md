# My-Power-BI-Project
This Power BI project provides a data-driven HR analytics dashboard for Palmoria Group, a Nigerian manufacturing company.

## Overview
This Power BI project provides a data-driven HR analytics dashboard for Palmoria Group, a Nigerian manufacturing company. The analysis was developed in response to organizational concerns about gender inequality, regulatory salary compliance, and overall compensation structure.


In response to concerns about gender inequality and salary disparities at Palmoria Group, this project delivers a data-driven solution using Microsoft Excel. It focuses on:

- Gender distribution across departments and regions
- Performance ratings by gender
- Salary distribution analysis and gender pay gap insights
- Compliance check with minimum salary regulations
- Bonus allocation based on department and performance
- Total compensation analysis and payouts by region


### Key Data Clean-Up Actions
1. Removed employees with no department or marked "NULL".
2. Excluded employees with missing salary (likely no longer with the company).
3. Marked missing gender as “Undisclosed”.
